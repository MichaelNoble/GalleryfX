# GalleryfX
GalleryfX Integration - WP plugin

Integrates the Jssor slideshow/gallery effects javscript/jQuery plugin. The plugin makes use of the TGM-Plugin-Activation framework to reccommend either WP-Better Attachments and/or Media Library Asstaint to manage the gallery attachments.  The admin metaboxes, shortcode builder, and plugin options where built using the ValPress framework. 

Archieved -  Rendering issues with the Jssor slideshow ( flashes and lines in the images ), along with the end of developement in the valPress framework rendered this a dead project.
